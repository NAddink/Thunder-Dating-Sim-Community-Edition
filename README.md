Thunder Dating Sim is back? Community edition?

# General structure
###### In it's current form (subject to change)

### Route System:
- Events (5 regular events, 1 final event) and date opportunities are separate
  - Events are where you meet (pick) the Thunder you want to interact with
    - i.e. you meet Aggro Thunder at the Esports lounge
  - The dialogue you choose while in the event with that Thunder will determine whether you have a date opportunity with him following the event
    - There will be 3 chances to successfully complete the event; you must pick at least 2 correct dialogue options in order to secure it
    - If unsuccessful, a default scene will play, in which you return to your dorm.
  - If successful in appealing to that particular Thunder, you will receive a  date opportunity immediately following that event
    - In date opportunities, you can choose between 4 locations to hang out with Thunder at
      - This includes Taco Bell
    - In those scenarios, location will not matter EXCEPT for if you choose Taco Bell. If you consistently choose dialogue options that discuss or interact with the Taco Bell worker, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, you will unlock the secret ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà route.
  - Dates will end with an affection point for the Thunder you spent it with
    - In other words, if you successfully get the date opportunity with that Thunder after an event, you‚Äôre assured gaining affection with that Thunder
  - The final event will be a big occasion (a game, pep rally, etc. -undetermined yet)
    - You can choose which final event to go to, but whether or not that event is followed by the good ending for that Thunder is determined by how many successful weeks you‚Äôve achieved with that Thunder
      - i.e. you had 3 completed weeks with AT and 2 completed weeks with PT. If you choose PT‚Äôs final event, it concludes with an unsuccessful ending. If you choose AT‚Äôs final event, it will conclude in the successful ending because you spent the majority of weeks with him.

### Current Issues:
- Assuming it takes 5 weeks to completely know a Thunder‚Äôs backstory and character, what do we do if the player only does 3 weeks of that Thunder, since you only need a minimum of 3 weeks to secure his successful ending?
  - Possible solutions include increasing the minimum number of weeks to land a successful ending to 4
    - To keep it fun, we can change the locations for each event so that players really have to think in order to predict where the Thunder they‚Äôre going for is at
    - IDEA: Players can unlock the perfect ending for their Thunder by completing 5 weeks with that specific Thunder and attending his respective final event; this will entail knowing all of Thunder‚Äôs backstory and understanding his personality, as well as gaining further closure on his primary conflict
